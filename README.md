#### Assignment:

- **Titanic Dataset**
  1. Find the **correlation** between ‘**survived**’ (target column) and ‘**sex**’ column for the Titanic use case in class.
      * Do you think we should keep this feature?
  2. Do at least **two visualizations** to describe or show correlations.
  3. Implement **Naïve Bayes** method using **scikit-learn** library and report the accuracy.
  
 
- **Glass Dataset**
  1. Implement **Naïve Bayes** method using **scikit-learn** library.
      * Use the glass dataset available in [Link](https://umkc.app.box.com/s/ea6wn1cidukan67t02j60nmp1ljln3kd) also provided in your assignment.
      * Use **train_test_split** to create training and testing part.
      * **Evaluate** the model on **testing** part using score and 
  
  2. Implement linear **SVM** method using **scikit** library
      * Use the glass dataset available in [Link](https://umkc.app.box.com/s/ea6wn1cidukan67t02j60nmp1ljln3kd) also provided in your assignment.
      * Use **train_test_split** to create training and testing part.
      * **Evaluate** the model on **testing** part using score and
